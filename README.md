This is my first 'The Odin Project' project.
After this project I should have built a Google Homepage copycat.

The things I expect to learn from this are programming the HTML elements in the header, footer and main section of the page.
After I manage that I will have to organise them on the page and make them similar to the real deal.

Before starting this I think I will make a lot of use of grids and flex options for the placement. 
I also expect to finetune the specific look and feel of the Google Homepage when everything is in place, by inspecting the actual Google Homepage.



After finishing:

I didn't use grids like I thought I would. There was a lot of flexing. I went all out on my personal quest to clone it nearly to the pixel. That might have been too much really but it was good practice. 

I definitely needed the dev tools for the specific colors, exact sizes of the search box and its shading, dito for the buttons.
